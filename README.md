# Interactive Frontend Project

The purpose of this project was to create a website for the module Interactive Frontend Development, showcasing knowledge of the frontend technologies HTML, CSS and Javascript. I based my site around a fictional 'glamping' (glamorous camping) website, which I named 'Hidden Huts'.

## UX and UI
I started the UX process by looking at other accomodation wesites, mainly [Canopy and Stars](https://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/). This helped me to get a better understanding of what a user would expect to see from such a site.
I created some low-fidelity wireframes using the Balsamiq wireframing tool. After I had created these, I moved onto some high-fidelity wireframes using Adobe Xd. Once I was happy with my website, I could then begin the build process.

You can find my user stories under the UI/UX folder in the main directory.
