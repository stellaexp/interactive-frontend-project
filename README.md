# Interactive Frontend Project

The purpose of this project was to create a website for the module Interactive Frontend Development, showcasing knowledge of the frontend technologies HTML, CSS and Javascript. I based my site around a fictional 'glamping' (glamorous camping) website, which I named 'Hidden Huts'

## UX and UI
I started the UX process by looking at other accomodation wesites, mainly [Canopy and Stars](https://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/). This helped me to get a better understanding of what a user would expect to see from such a site.
I created some low-fidelity wireframes using the Balsamiq wireframing tool. After I had created these, I moved onto some high-fidelity wireframes using Adoe Xd. Once I was happy with my website, I could then begin the build process.

You can find my user stories under the UI/UX folder in the main directory.

# Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

# Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
