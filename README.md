# Interactive Frontend Project

The purpose of this project was to create a website for the module Interactive Frontend Development, showcasing knowledge of the frontend technologies HTML, CSS and Javascript. I based my site around a fictional 'glamping' (glamorous camping) website, which I named 'Hidden Huts'.

## UX and UI
I started the UX process by looking at other accomodation wesites, mainly [Canopy and Stars](https://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/). This helped me to get a better understanding of what a user would expect to see from such a site.
I created some low-fidelity wireframes using the Balsamiq wireframing tool. After I had created these, I moved onto some high-fidelity wireframes using Adobe Xd. Once I was happy with my website, I could then begin the build process.

You can find my user stories under the UI/UX folder in the main directory.

## Features

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
